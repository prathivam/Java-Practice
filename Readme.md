## I/O Streams
- Scanner - best for simple text and when you want to parse numbers or words easily.
- BufferedReader ( BufferedReader, BufferedWriter ) - best for large text files, because it is faster and reads line by line.
- FileReader ( FileReader, FileWriter ) - best for simple character data when you don't need advanced features like buffering.
- FileInputStream ( FileInputStream, FileOutputStream ) - best for binary data (images, audio, PDFs) or when you need full control of raw bytes.
